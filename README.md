# **Projects:**


### 1. Agriculture Crops Yield (R):
#### - [Project Dataset]()

This project investigates the impact of rainfall and temperature on crop yield using R. By analyzing data on these environmental factors and their correlation with crop productivity, the study aims to identify optimal conditions for maximizing yields. The findings will provide actionable recommendations for farmers and suggest strategies for mitigating the effects of extreme weather conditions, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.

#### ֎ Analysis outcome:
♦ *Total yield is strongly affected by rainfall (0.7680389).* <br>
♦ *The affect of temperature on total yield is minimal (0.08402748).* <br>
♦ *Harvesting days are not affected by rainfall (0.0003817865).* <br>
♦ *Harvesting days are not affected by temperature (0.005686612).* <br>
♦ *Optimal Rainfall amount for high yield: 154.5653 mm .* <br>
♦ *Optimal Temperature for high yield: 15 °C.* <br>


### 2. Global Electronics Retailer (SQL):
#### - [Project Dataset]()

In response to the ongoing sea freight logistical challenges and political tensions in the manufacturing country, the Global Electronic Retailer is proactively seeking to expand its inventory for North American customers. This strategic initiative aims to ensure a consistent supply of products, enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining market competitiveness.

#### ֎ Strategic Considerations:
♦ *Should we restock products with highest sales or highest profit margin?* <br>
♦ *What are the top 5 products we need to order in a large quantity?* <br>
♦ *What is the cost of ordering these products?* <br>
♦ *When the products will arrive?* <br>

#### ֎ Analysis outcome: Restocking products with highest sales in North America:
♦ *Feasibility: Restocking products with the highest sales is more feasible due to lower costs and shorter lead times.* <br>
♦ *Risk: Restocking high-sales products carries lower risk due to established demand and manageable supply chain timelines.* <br>
♦ *Benefits: While restocking high-margin products offers higher profitability per unit, restocking high-sales products ensures steady revenue and customer satisfaction.* <br>


### 3. Shark Attacks (Power BI):
#### - [Project Dataset]()

Shark attacks pose a significant concern for beachgoers, particularly surfers and swimmers. This project leverages a comprehensive dataset on global shark attacks to uncover patterns and trends. By examining variables such as location, fatality rate, and date, I aim to generate valuable insights that can help mitigate risks and enhance safety protocols for ocean enthusiasts.
