# **Projects:**


### 1. Agriculture Crops Yield (R):
#### - [Project Dataset]()

This project investigates the impact of rainfall and temperature on crop yield using R. By analyzing data on these environmental factors and their correlation with crop productivity, the study aims to identify optimal conditions for maximizing yields. The findings will provide actionable recommendations for farmers and suggest strategies for mitigating the effects of extreme weather conditions, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.

#### ֎ Analysis outcome:
♦ *Total yield is strongly affected by rainfall (0.7680389).* <br>
♦ *The affect of temperature on total yield is minimal (0.08402748).* <br>
♦ *Harvesting days are not affected by rainfall (0.0003817865).* <br>
♦ *Harvesting days are not affected by temperature (0.005686612).* <br>
♦ *Optimal Rainfall amount for high yield: 154.5653 mm .* <br>
♦ *Optimal Temperature for high yield: 15 °C.* <br>


### 2. Global Electronics Retailer (SQL):
#### - [Project Dataset]()

In response to the ongoing sea freight logistical challenges and political tensions in the manufacturing country, the Global Electronic Retailer is proactively seeking to expand its inventory for North American customers. This strategic initiative aims to ensure a consistent supply of products, enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining market competitiveness.

#### ֎ Strategic Considerations:
♦ *Should we restock products with highest sales or highest profit margin?* <br>
♦ *What are the top 5 products we need to order in a large quantity?* <br>
♦ *What is the cost of ordering these products?* <br>
♦ *When the products will arrive?* <br>

#### ֎ Analysis outcome: Restocking products with highest sales in North America:
♦ *Feasibility: Restocking products with the highest sales is more feasible due to lower costs and shorter lead times.* <br>
♦ *Risk: Restocking high-sales products carries lower risk due to established demand and manageable supply chain timelines.* <br>
♦ *Benefits: While restocking high-margin products offers higher profitability per unit, restocking high-sales products ensures steady revenue and customer satisfaction.* <br>


### 3. Student Mental Health (Power BI):
#### - [Project Dataset]()

This dataset offers a detailed look into student demographics, well-being, and academic success. It includes key details like gender, and age, as well as academic factors such as degree level, major, academic year, and CGPA.

It also covers residential status, highlighting the impact of living on or off-campus, and personal experiences with discrimination, harassment, or bullying. These insights are crucial for understanding mental health challenges and academic outcomes.

Lifestyle factors like physical activity and sleep patterns are included, along with students' satisfaction with their studies and perceived academic pressure. This helps gauge overall happiness and engagement.
The dataset addresses major stressors like academic pressure, financial concerns, and social relationships, all of which affect mental health and academic performance. It also tracks mental health indicators such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, providing valuable data for identifying trends and areas for intervention.

Overall, this dataset is a rich resource for improving student support services, mental health resources, and creating a healthier, more inclusive campus environment.

#### ֎ Research Findings:
♦ *There is a positive correlation between CGPA and average sleep duration. Students with higher CGPAs tend to get more sleep on average.* <br>
♦ *Students engaged in sports generally report lower academic pressure and depression levels compared to those who do not participate in sports.* <br>
♦ *There is a positive correlation between study satisfaction and academic workload. Higher academic workloads are associated with higher study satisfaction.* <br>
♦ *Online entertainment and Religious activities are associated with higher isolation levels and lower Anxiety levels* <br>
♦ *Financial concerns are relatively consistent across different degree majors, with no significant variation observed.* <br>
♦ *Depression and anxiety levels tend to increase as students progress to higher academic years.* <br>
♦ *Females are more likely to engage in religious activities and social connections, while males prefer Religious activities, and online entertainment.* <br>
♦ *Students engaged in sports generally report lower academic pressure and depression levels compared to those who do not participate in sports.* <br>
